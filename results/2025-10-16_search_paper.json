    "title": "Enhancing OTP-Vote: Strengthening End-to-End Verifiability and Auditability with Machine Learning Techniques",
    "authors": "Silvia Bast, Narayan Debnath, Mario Berón, Daniel Riesco, Germán Montejano",
    "abstract": "Electronic voting systems aim to modernize electoral processes by improving efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. However, concerns about transparency, security, and voter anonymity have hindered their widespread adoption—especially in countries where traditional paper-based systems remain deeply rooted. This article presents an enhanced version of the OTP-Vote model, a cryptographically secure system based on One-Time Pad encryption and multi-channel data storage. Two major contributions address common criticisms which are the integration of End-to-End Verifiability (E2EV) and the inclusion of accessible audit mechanisms. E2EV enables voters and the public to verify vote integrity without compromising secrecy, while audit enhancements offer traceability and support for manual verification. Mathematical modeling and simulations confirm a negligible risk of voter identification. Machine learning techniques were applied during the simulation phases to improve scenario analysis and optimize key parameters. These improvements aim to enhance transparency and foster public trust, supporting the safe adoption of electronic voting in democratic systems.

    "title": "Integrating Machine Learning with Empirical Mode Decomposition for Multiple Fault Diagnosis in Rotating Machinery",
    "authors": "Sunil Kumar, Swapna Singh, Nitesh P. Yelve",
    "abstract": "To correctly diagnose multiple faults in rotating elements particularly bearing, in this paper, the authors have proposed, wavelet-based denoising, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and unsupervised machine learning-based method principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) for fault diagnosis. Bearing having faults in outer race, inner race, and angular misalignment induced artificially and assembled to experimental portable setup at the laboratory. Acquisition of the vibration data is done using FFT analyser which is SPM made LEONOVA DIAMOND® and data are processed using CONDMASTER RUBY® and MATLAB® software. Firstly, the signal is denoised using wavelet transform. After denoising, EMD is applied for denoised signal decomposition into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). After EMD, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied on IMFs followed by independent component analysis (ICA) to get independent components, which are then analysed to extract fault related characteristic features. This paper proposes Wavelet-EMD-PCA-ICA-based technique for fault diagnosis and shows convincing results particularly for small bearings and at lower rpm, especially when multiple faults are present, where fault signatures are difficult to identify in a normal FFT spectrum.

    "innovative": "The methodological innovation lies in the proposed multi-stage signal processing and unsupervised machine learning framework for fault diagnosis. This framework sequentially applies wavelet-based denoising, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA). Specifically, it uses wavelet transform for initial signal cleaning, followed by EMD to decompose the denoised signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and then applies PCA and ICA on these IMFs to extract fault-related characteristic features. This integrated approach aims to enhance the identification of subtle fault signatures, particularly in complex scenarios involving multiple faults, small bearings, and low RPM."

    "authors": "Jeferson David Gallo-Aristizabal, Daniel Escobar-Grisales, Cristian David Ríos-Urrego, Jesús Francisco Vargas-Bonilla, Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave",
    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to various motor impairments, including bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and resting tremor. These symptoms affect fine motor skills including handwriting. One possible way to model this biosignal is with deep learning methods; however the lack of large enough annotated datasets imposes a major challenge in this topic. This paper focuses on using data augmentation (DA) and transfer learning (TL) techniques to improve the classification performance of PD patients vs. healthy control (HC) subjects across five handwriting tasks. Three methodological approaches were explored: (1) a baseline, (2) DA and TL using micrographia emulation with EMNIST characters, and (3) denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Among these approaches, the second one achieved the highest classification accuracy of 67%, representing a 9.7% improvement over the baseline. The DDPM method provided moderate improvements, particularly in tasks that were shape-similar to the pretraining data (e.g., Numbers and ID), achieving accuracy gains of up to 8.7%. Overall, the findings suggest that incorporating domain-specific TL strategies and generative models like DDPMs help in addressing data scarcity and enhancing classification performance.

    "title": "Application of Machine Learning in Condition Monitoring System for Tool Wear Prediction",
    "authors": "Neelesh Kumar Sahu, Ashok Kumar Verma, Ruchi Patel",
    "abstract": "Successful deep learning-based approaches for tool wear condition monitoring (TWCM) need large sample labelling and a consistent probability distribution across training and testing data. But these two requirements are not often easy to meet in real experimental data; thus, those approaches’ performance takes a major hit. This paper proposes generation of training and testing data for training of artificial neural network (ANN) using response surface model (RSM). Sound emission and tool vibrations signals based on multisensory approach are utilized along with milling parameters for developing RSM model. By utilizing analysis of variance (ANOVA), we were able to statistically validate the response model and determine the most efficient inputs for a set of milling parameters. The model’s efficacy within the specified domain of machining parameters is demonstrated by the correlation coefficient (R2) value of 99.2%. Furthermore, data are generated for training and testing using this validated RSM. ANN model is evaluated by mean square error (MSE) which is 4.2979 e-6 and regression R value which is 0.99. The model prediction in testing has shown good accuracy which reveals that considering the sound pressure of machining and tool vibration as input parameters for the model development can help improve the accuracy of tool wear prediction.

    "title": "Deep learning, transformers and graph neural networks: a linear algebra perspective",
    "authors": "Abdelkader Baggag, Yousef Saad",
    "abstract": "In an age where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being integrated into nearly every domain of science and engineering, it has become essential for experts in Numerical Linear Algebra to explore the foundational elements of deep learning and identify ways to contribute to its development. What’s particularly exciting is that Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) lies at the heart of Machine Learning and more broadly AI. All AI techniques fundamentally rely on four core components: data, optimization methods, statistical intuition, and linear algebra. The initial phase of any neural network model involves transforming the problem into one that can be tackled using numerical methods, particularly through optimization techniques. Thus, in Large Language Models (LLMs) this first step involves mapping words or subwords into tokens, which are then embedded into Euclidean spaces. From that point, LLMs rely heavily on vectors, matrices, and tensors. The aim of this article is to outline the essential components of deep learning methods from a linear algebra perspective. It will cover deep neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and the concept of “attention,” which plays a crucial role in large language models as well as other machine learning applications. A significant portion of the discussion will focus on methods that leverage graphs in neural networks, such as Graph Convolutional Networks. The paper will conclude with reflections on the future role of numerical linear algebra in the age of AI.  ### Explore related subjects  Discover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.  - [Algebra](https://link.springer.com/subjects/algebra) - [Computational Neuroscience](https://link.springer.com/subjects/computational-neuroscience) - [Linear Algebra](https://link.springer.com/subjects/linear-algebra) - [Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/subjects/machine-learning) - [Multilinear Algebra](https://link.springer.com/subjects/multilinear-algebra) - [Symbolic AI](https://link.springer.com/subjects/symbolic-ai)  [Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=11075)  Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript.",

    "title": "AI-Driven Quality Control in the Built Environment: A Machine Learning and Expert System Approach",
    "authors": "Seyi Stephen, Clinton Aigbavboa",
    "abstract": "This study addressed the problem of poor quality control in the built environment due to the limitations of traditional methods, which were often slow, costly, and prone to human error. There was a need to explore how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and expert systems, could improve quality control across the construction lifecycle: pre-construction, construction, and post-construction. The study adopted a scientometric and narrative analysis approach. Scientometric methods were used to analyse publication trends, keyword co-occurrences, and country contributions using data from Scopus and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer and Biblioshiny tools were used for data visualisation, while narrative findings explored real-world applications of AI in each construction phase. The findings showed a growing global interest in AI-driven quality control, with increasing publications and citations in recent years. The analysis identified four main clusters: sensor intelligence, intelligent automation, predictive diagnostics, and real-time intelligence. Each cluster contributed uniquely to quality control through data monitoring, decision-making, and predictive maintenance. The study concluded that AI, through machine learning and expert systems, could transform construction quality control by improving efficiency, safety, and performance. However, it also noted the need for further research using real-world case studies and exploring AI adoption in small construction firms.

    "title": "Reducing collision counts at intersections using reinforcement learning-based adaptive speed control",
    "authors": "Kaito Kumagae, Tenta Suzuki, Mao Tobisawa, Tomohiro Harada, Johei Matsuoka, Yuki Itoh, Clive Jancen Kawaoto, Kiyohiko Hattori",
    "abstract": "Research on cooperative control of autonomous vehicles using reinforcement learning has gained attention in the recent years. Conventional intersection control using traffic signals faces challenges in flexibly responding to changing traffic conditions, making balancing safety improvement and traffic flow optimization difficult. This study proposes an intersection agent that dynamically adjusts the entry speed of vehicles at unsignalized intersections and explores a method to acquire control policies through reinforcement learning. In the proposed method, the intersection agent observes the number of vehicles from each entry direction and implements continuous speed limits for vehicles in each direction, enabling control that responds to congestion conditions and collision risks. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) deep reinforcement learning algorithm was used to learn the control policy. Simulation evaluation results showed that compared with Matsuda et al.'s method (Kishi et al. in 27:513–520, 2022), the average number of vehicles passing through was 496.4 for the proposed method and 488.6 for the conventional method, confirming that control efficiency was maintained. In addition, the number of collisions within the intersection was 9.8 on average for the proposed method, compared to 31.3 for the conventional method, achieving a significant reduction. In a four-way intersection scenario, the proposed method achieved an average vehicle throughput of 218.6 and recorded 3.3 collisions, while the baseline method yielded 181.3 and 11.0, respectively. This represents a 20.6% increase in throughput and a 70% reduction in collisions, demonstrating a significant improvement in both traffic efficiency and safety. The proposed method learned an adaptive control policy that does not impose speed limits when traffic conditions are stable, but temporarily strengthens restrictions only during congestion or high-collision risk situations, showing potential for simultaneously optimizing traffic flow and improving safety.

    "innovative": "The methodological innovation lies in the design of an intersection agent that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (Proximal Policy Optimization) to dynamically control unsignalized intersections. This agent implements continuous speed limits for vehicles entering from each direction, a departure from conventional discrete signal controls. This enables the acquisition of an adaptive policy that selectively imposes speed restrictions only during congestion or high-collision risk situations, optimizing both traffic flow and safety."

    "title": "Enhancing the Water Optimization Algorithm Using the Dragonfly Approach",
    "authors": "Soha M. Ismail, Yasser F. Hassan, Shawkat K. Guirguis",
    "abstract": "Meta-heuristic algorithms, a category within artificial intelligence, have gained significant traction for solving complex optimization tasks. This research introduces a novel hybrid technique that integrates the water optimization algorithm with the dragonfly algorithm, termed the water optimization-dragonfly algorithm. The water optimization algorithm is inspired by the molecular behavior of water particles, particularly by their bonding and mobility, while the dragonfly algorithm emulates the dynamic and static swarming behaviors of dragonflies. The performance of this method was tested using standard benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension functions, and compared against the classical water optimization algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid water optimization-dragonfly algorithm significantly outperforms the traditional approach, offering faster convergence and delivering optimal solutions across most benchmark functions. The hybrid approach effectively manages high-dimensional problems and reduces localization errors compared to existing solutions. Overall, the water optimization-dragonfly algorithm demonstrates significant versatility and effectiveness in solving a variety of optimization challenges.

    "title": "Analysis of Educational Performance Test Results Using Machine Learning Models",
    "authors": "Narayan Debnath, Andrés Francisco Farías, Ana Gabriela Garis, Daniel Riesco, Germán Antonio Montejano, Sebastián Javier Farías, Andrés Alejandro Farías",
    "abstract": "The present paper is predicated on the utilization of disparate Machine Learning Models in the standardized assessment tests “Aprender,” which were developed in Argentina, for the purpose of measuring Performance in Language and Mathematics. The models also collect information on conditioning factors that allow for the analysis of the contexts in which these learning processes take place. The present study proposes to implement this approach with data from the 2016 edition of the sixth-grade assessment in Elementary School. In the research stage, the Performance in Language and Mathematics was analyzed, and the results are presented in this document. To this end, a preliminary selection of features was conducted, followed by the selection of five Machine Learning Models. The model that attained the highest level of accuracy was identified as the optimal choice. Furthermore, the datasets utilized were subjected to a preliminary treatment, during which missing and negative data were completed using the mean of each respective column. The optimal results were determined based on the most effective calculation parameters, as determined by the evaluation tests. In each case, the most significant features that led to the best results were identified within the previously selected set of features. Finally, an analysis was conducted to assess the significance of these features across two performance groupings: “Satisfactory/Advanced” and “Basic/Below Basic”.

    "title": "Probabilistic Power Flow Analysis in Hybrid Systems Using Machine Learning Techniques",
    "authors": "Ricardo Rincón, Harrynson Ramirez-Murillo, Fabian Salazar-Caceres, Martha P. Camargo-Martínez, Juan S. Zambrano-Fajardo, Y. Lorena Tique-Madrigal",
    "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources (RES) into power systems introduces significant uncertainties that challenge static stability. Traditional deterministic methods fail to capture these stochastic effects, requiring probabilistic approaches. This paper shows a probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis methodology in hybrid power systems incorporating RES. The impact of uncertainties from renewable generation and demand is evaluated using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Machine learning (ML) techniques are used to fine-tune LHS sample size selection for enhanced computational efficiency, specifically the elbow detection method using the Euclidean norm versus sample size. The study applies these techniques to a 3-bus test system, the methodology shows the LHS’s ability to achieve comparable accuracy to MCS using only 650 samples, reducing computational time by over 90% (from 34.49 s to 3.17 s). Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) effectively capture multimodal uncertainties in generation and demand profiles. The results highlight LHS’s superior efficiency and low relative errors, making it ideal for large-scale systems, maintaining accuracy in capturing the probabilistic behavior of power flow variables such as voltage magnitudes and angles. This approach enhances risk assessment and supports sustainable energy system design by enabling rapid, accurate PPF analysis under high RES penetration.
